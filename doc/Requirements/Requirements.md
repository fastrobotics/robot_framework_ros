# Requirements

The following list all the requirements of this project.

# Requirement Type: General
The following are general requirements for this project.

| Requirement             | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SW Lifecycle Management | SW that is not needed shall be deleted.  If required, this can be retreived via versioning tools.                                  |
| Project Management      | Azure Devops shall be used to manage the various work items for this content.  Access to Azure Devops for this project is assumed. |


# Requirement Type: Documentation
The following are requirements for this project related to Documentation.

| Requirement        | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Documentation | Doxygen shall be used for Code Documentation.  Documentation should be kept up to and checked via automated tools.         |
| SW Architecture    | All modules shall have at least a Class Diagram, and optionally a sequence diagram.                                        |
| Templates          | Templates shall be used extensively.  As the templates change over time, modules may need to be updated with new guidance. |

# Requirement Type: Software Design
The following are requirements for this project related to Software Design.

| Requirement             | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Follow SOLID principles | All Software created shall attempt to follow SOLID best practices                                                                                                 |
| Obvious design          | Software shall be designed to provide the minimum amount of surprise/maximum amount of implied assumptions.  i.e. a Module of name A should only do A, and not B. |
| File Location Proximity | Files should be located near each other.  For example, documentation relating to the design of SW should be located near the software implemented.                |
